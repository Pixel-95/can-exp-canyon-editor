    "faq_publish_time_q": "How long does it take until my submitted canyon or edit is published?",
    "faq_publish_time_a": "We usually review and publish new or updated canyons within a few days. The exact time may vary depending on the complexity and completeness of the data.",
    "faq_share_trips_q": "Can I share my canyoning trips with others?",
    "faq_share_trips_a": "Yes! You can post that you completed a canyon and add a short report about the current circumstances (e.g., water level, obstacles, safety conditions). This helps other users get up-to-date information and makes the community stronger.",
