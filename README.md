## Overview
With Canyon Editor, new canyons can be introduced for Canyon Explore in a structured way.  
Create routes with start, waypoint, and end points on the map, then export the canyon data for app integration.

## Why It Stands Out
- Built specifically for adding canyon content to Canyon Explore
- Fast, map-based editing of ordered route points
- Clean export format for integration into existing workflows
- Desktop app workflow for Windows and macOS

## Live Demo
Currently available as a desktop application (no browser demo).
